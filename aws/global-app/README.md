# Keywords in AWS infrastructure

## Region

- A physical location around the world where we cluster data centers.
- Each consists of a minimum of 3, isolated, and physically separate AZs within a geographic area.

## Availability Zone (AZ)

- One or more discrete data centers.
- All traffic between AZs is encrypted.
- AZs are physically separated by a meaningful distance.
- Has independent power, cooling, and physical security.
- Connected via redundant power, ultra-low-latency networks.

## Edge locations

- AWS data centers designed to deliver services with the lowest [latency](../glossary.md#latencyGlobalGlossary) possible.
- Usually part of a larger CDN distribution.
- Optimized for caching and delivering content to end-users efficiently.
- Closer to users than Regions or AZs.
- A subset of services which use edge locations:
  - CloudFront.
  - Route 53
  - Web Application Firewall..
  - AWS Shield.

## Points of presence (PoP)

- A <table style="display:inline;"><tr><td>physical location</td></tr><tr><td>facility</td></tr><tr><td>data center</td></tr></table> where two or more <table style="display:inline;"><tr><td>networks</td></tr> <tr><td>communication devices</td></tr></table> share a connection.
- AWS has a globally distributed point of presence (PoP) network.
- PoPs host:
  - **Amazon CloudFront**: a Content Delivery Network (CDN).
  - **Amazon Route 53**: a public Domain Name System (DNS).
  - **Resolution service**.
  - **AWS Global Accelerator (AGA)**: an edge networking optimization service.
- Each PoP is isolated from the others.

### `Edge locations === PoP`

They are related concepts in network architecture but not same.

    <tr>
      <td>Infrastructure</td>
      <td>Smaller data centers strategically deployed in densely populated areas or key internet exchange points (IXPs).</td>
      <td>Vary in complexity, The key requirement is the ability to interconnect different networks efficiently.</td>

      <td>Prioritizes content delivery speed and user experience.</td>
      <td>Prioritizes network connectivity and data exchange.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Content Storage</td>
      <td>Robust caching servers, storing frequently accessed content like website assets, videos, or static files.</td>
      <td>Generally do not store significant amounts of user data or content. Just route data packets efficiently.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

In other word:

- **PoP**: an intersection where data traffic from various networks meets and gets routed.
- **Edge Location**: a strategically positioned warehouse[^1] within a content delivery network, ensuring fast and efficient delivery of cached content to users in a specific region.

# Global apps

- Decreased [latency](../glossary.md#latencyGlobalGlossary) => better UX.
- Disaster recovery => better [availability](../glossary.md#availabilityGlobalGlossary) (HA).
