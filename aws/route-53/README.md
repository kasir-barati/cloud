## Route 53 routing policies

- Simple routing policy:

  - No health check.

  ![Simple routing policy infographic](./simple-routing-policy.png)

- Weighted routing policy:

  - Distributes requests between different EC2 instances. Some sort of load balancing.
  - We assign weight to each EC2 instance and it will redirect requests to each based on the weight.

- Latency routing policy:

  - Connects users based on their location to the closest server.

- Failover routing policy:

  - Perform health check on the EC2 instances and in case of unhealthy it will redirect requests to the failover instance.
