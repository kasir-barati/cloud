# Cloud

1. I love to hear your thoughts about the things that I am doing here. So reach out. Or better yet, formulate your thoughts in a GH issue.
2. Most of the things I am putting in this repo are my own original creation, although I'm not reinventing the wheel when it is out there. So I might have taken some parts of other's creation and modified them to suit my needs. So credits goes still to the original creator of those contents.

> Initial codebase: this repo was intended to be a professional RESTful API in time, but it didn't come to fruition. So now you can see my endeavour [here](https://github.com/kasir-barati/paas-system/tree/initial-branch).

# Handwritings

I first started by jotting down on a paper what I was learning about AWS but then I change my mind and decided to document it in a more accessible way. That's the back story behind this exhaustive doc. But you can always find my handwriting [here](./aws/handwritings/README.md).
