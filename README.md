# Note

1. I love to hear your thoughts about the things that I am doing here. So reach out. Or better yet, formulate your thoughts in a GH issue.
2. Most of the things I am putting in this repo are my own original creation, although I'm not reinventing the wheel when it is out there. So I might have taken some parts of other's creation and modified them to suit my needs. So credits goes still to the original creator of those contents.

# Initial codebase

This repo was intended to be a professional RESTful API in time, but it didn't come to fruition. So now you can see my endeavour [here](https://github.com/kasir-barati/paas-system/tree/initial-branch).

# AWS cloud practitioner course

And since I love cloud and I just took an AWS course in Udemy to hone my skills and knowledge in AWS I created a [new branch](https://github.com/kasir-barati/paas-system/tree/cloud-practitioner) where I am marking up my notes.
